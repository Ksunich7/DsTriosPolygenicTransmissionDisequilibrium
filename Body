/DsTriosPolygenicTransmissionDisequilibrium/Body/1Raw/!.gitkeep      # raw data, we never modify them here 
/DsTriosPolygenicTransmissionDisequilibrium/Body/2Derived/   # derived data = modified raw data for several potential  analyses. The less number of the files the better
/DsTriosPolygenicTransmissionDisequilibrium/Body/3Results/     # one table (one file) - one statistical analysis.
/DsTriosPolygenicTransmissionDisequilibrium/Body/4Figures/    # only figures. I recommend to name figures as the R script, which generates them, for example ‘TCVersusGenTimeInMammals.R.01.pdf’
